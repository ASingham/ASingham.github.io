# Hi mysterious friend,

This is a webcrawl event I coded for PHBC Switch. The idea is that there are a series of challenges that the children would have to complete.
Challenges include: Using google to find very specific trivia questions, solving puzzles, photography challenges, etc.
I'm re-writing this read me after the social so I myself can't be bothered explaining stuff. Hopefully the code is enough for you haha

Love,

~ Sachin
